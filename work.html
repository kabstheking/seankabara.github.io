								<h2><p> What am I looking for?</p></h2>
								</header>
								<text>
								<p>I'm looking for a intern/temporary position in electrical engineering, ideally in the field of power electronics,  embedded systems or medical devices. I have a strong interest in hybrid and electric vehicle technology, and I'm eager to apply my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment. I'd also like to add that I am definitely a people person. I love working with others and I love being able to help people. I am looking for a job that will allow me to do that while also allowing me to grow my skills as an engineer.</p>

									<h2><p>Internships</h2></p>
								<h3><p>ABB | Technical Support Internship</h3></p>
							
								</header>
							
								<text>
								<p>During my time on the technical support team, I assisted customers in troubleshooting variable frequency drives and electric motors, developing a deep understanding of HVAC systems and how VFDs optimize their performance. I also analyzed customer data to ensure that tech support could clearly communicate client needs to other departments, and collaborated closely with co-workers to improve our organizational documentation systems. This hands-on experience not only honed my diagnostic skills but also strengthened my ability to streamline internal processes and foster cross-team communication.</p>

								<h2><p>Other Work Experience</h2></p>
								<h3><p>MSOE Residence Life | Grohmann Tower</h3></p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>As a student employee on a tight‐knit facilities team, I helped maintain a $65 million, 400+-resident apartment building entirely without full‐time custodians—working flexible hours, tackling tasks independently, and partnering with fellow leads to keep our community both welcoming and efficient. I greeted residents and guests, communicated directly with tower occupants to resolve issues, and liaised with university administration—ranging from department heads to vice presidents—as well as residence‐life staff to continuously improve building operations. By analyzing resident feedback, collaborating with RAs, and servicing individual needs, I strengthened our documentation systems and streamlined processes—all while balancing these responsibilities alongside a demanding academic workload.</p>

								<h3><p>Culver's | Crew Lead</h3></p>
								</header>
								<text>
								<p>As a Crew Lead at Culver’s, I partnered closely with fellow leads and managers to enhance the customer experience and boost team productivity, delegating roles effectively to ensure smooth operations during peak hours. I took pride in maintaining a clean, safe kitchen and dining environment, working flexible shifts and motivating my teammates to deliver friendly, efficient service. By fostering a positive atmosphere—both among co-workers and for our guests—I played a key role in elevating overall satisfaction and operational excellence.</p>
